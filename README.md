# Timeline of artists

A timeline of artists who lived between 1500 and 1700 and were based in Amsterdam.

This project contains:
- GSAP TweenMax
- GSAP SplitText plugin
- Adamlink opendata
- ES6, ES7 code
- Pretty things

## Project
This project is a prototype built in a week, so my code is not that pretty (sorry for that).
I mainly focussed on aesthetics and animation.
